1) Hyperledger Project is an open source collaborative effort created to advance Cross-industry blockchain technologies. It is a project under the Linux Foundation.

2) Hyperledger is not a single project but a collection of projects under the Hyperledger Initiative.

There are two types of projects.

First one is the frameworks.

Hyperledger Fabric is a distributed ledger technology framework.

And then there are tools.

Hyperledger Composer is a tool that can accelerate the development of applications on Hyperledger fabric.


3) Hyperledger Fabric is a (DLT) distributed ledger technology framework for building business blockchain applications.

Distributed Ledger Technology for the Business

There are four aspects of Hyperledger fabric distributed ledger technology that makes it suitable for implementing blockchain applications for business, 
1) Permissioned network :
	*) Members Identities are known
	*) Participants have role based access
	*) Members of the business blockchain network would always be known entities and the participants will be able to take actions based on their roles.
	*) Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned network in which identities are managed and roles are assigned.

2) Confidential Transactions : confidentiality of the transactions.
	*) Not All Transactions should be visible to all 
	*) Hyperledger fabric based blockchain network allows the members to transact privately.
	*) Members can transact privately
	*) That means their transactions are visible only to the counterparties and are not visible to the other members on the network.
3) No cryptocurrency : No need for cryptocurrency, for transactions 
	*) No incentivization needed
	*) In the case of a business blockchain network, there is no need for crypto tokens to be given out as a fee for the execution of the transactions.
	*) Hyperledger Fabric does not have the concept of cryptocurrencies.

4) Programmable : Programmability.
	*) Smart Contracts
	*) Business Logic Implementation
