SOLO | KAFKA | RAFT for ordering and distribution

1) The order is implemented as a single binary file.
2) It requires the genesis block for initialization and the runtime properties for the order is managed in a configuration file in Yaml format.
3) Fabric Network needs a messaging infrastructure for the distribution of blocks. This messaging infrastructure is provided in three ways. Either it can be solo or raft, or it can be Kafka.
Solo is built into the binary for the order, but since it's built into the order, it cannot be used in the form of a cluster.
4) SOLO is built into the binary 
5) Orderer Binary needs access to the genesis block (genesis block needed for orderer initialization)
6) Run time needs access to orderer's msp and order.yaml file 
6) the orderer writes the information about the blocks to the file system in the ledger data
7) Orderer Binary exposes gRPC services to the peers and clients. 
8) Logging level controlled by env variable FABRIC_LOGGING_FORMAT
